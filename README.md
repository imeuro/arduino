###temperINO
TemperINO is my first attempt to build an Arduino powered WiFi Thermostat (or even better GSM)
it's actually a work in progress and involves:
- an *Arduino Uno Rev 3* that acts as a thermometer and relay switcher
- a *web app* based on Bootstrap to control the heater from your phone/tablet/computer 
- a *Raspberry Pi 2* that reads and elaborates the data between the web app and Arduino, and acts as PHP server for the web app
